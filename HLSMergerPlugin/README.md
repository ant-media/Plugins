# HLS Merger Plugin
This is a HLS Merger plugin project for Ant Media Server. The **HLSMerger Plugin** enhances the HLS experience in two key ways:

1. Creating an HLS stream with multiple resolutions  
2. Creating an HLS stream with multiple audio tracks  

---

## 1. Creating an HLS Stream with Multiple Resolutions

Streaming with multiple resolutions is crucial for Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR). ABR dynamically adjusts the video quality based on the viewerâ€™s internet speed, providing a seamless viewing experience. However, ABR requires transcoding, which can be CPU-intensive. While Ant Media Server supports ABR, some users may prefer to handle this process on the client side.

The **HLSMerger Plugin** offers a solution by allowing users to create streams with different resolutions and then merge these streams into a single HLS master file. This eliminates the need for transcoding on the server side, reducing CPU usage.

##### Example: Creating and Merging Multi-Resolution Streams

To publish multiple RTMP streams with different resolutions using FFmpeg, run the following commands:

```bash
ffmpeg -re -i ~/test/bunnyz.mp4 -s 1920x1080 -codec copy -f flv rtmp://localhost/LiveApp/stream1
ffmpeg -re -i ~/test/bunnyz.mp4 -s 1280x720 -codec copy -f flv rtmp://localhost/LiveApp/stream2
ffmpeg -re -i ~/test/bunnyz.mp4 -s 640x360 -codec copy -f flv rtmp://localhost/LiveApp/stream3
```

Once these streams are created, merge them using the following REST API call:


```bash
curl -X POST -H "Accept: Application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://localhost:5080/LiveApp/rest/v1/hls-merger/multi-resolution-stream/merged_stream -d '["stream1", "stream2", "stream3"]'
```

This creates a single HLS master file pointing to the different resolutions of the stream.

To delete this merged stream, use the following command:

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Accept: Application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://localhost:5080/LiveApp/rest/v1/hls-merger/multi-resolution-stream/merged_stream
```

## 2. Creating an HLS Stream with Multiple Audio Tracks
Adding multiple audio tracks to a single video stream is ideal for multilingual streaming. The HLSMerger Plugin enables users to merge a video stream with multiple audio streams into a single HLS playlist (M3U8 file). HLS players can then present these audio options to viewers, allowing them to select their preferred language or audio track.

##### Example: Creating and Merging Multi-Audio Streams
Start by creating a video stream and separate audio streams using FFmpeg:

Create the Video Stream

```bash
ffmpeg -re -i ~/test/bunnyz.mp4 -codec copy -f flv rtmp://localhost/LiveApp/videoStream
```

Create Audio Streams

```bash
ffmpeg -re -i ~/test/bunnyz.mp4 -codec copy -map 0:a:0 -f flv rtmp://localhost/LiveApp/audiostream1
ffmpeg -re -i ~/test/bunnyz.mp4 -codec copy -map 0:a:1 -f flv rtmp://localhost/LiveApp/audiostream2
```

Merge the audio streams with the video stream using the following REST API call:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Accept: Application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://localhost:5080/LiveApp/rest//v1/hls-merger/videoStream/multi-audio-stream/merged_stream -d '["audiostream1", "audiostream2"]'
```

Once merged, the M3U8 file will use the audio group feature of HLS, enabling audio selection in compatible players.

To delete this merged stream, use the following command:

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Accept: Application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://localhost:5080/LiveApp/rest/v1/hls-merger/multi-audio-stream/merged_stream
```

# How to Build and Install the HLSMerger Plugin
## Building the Plugin
Clone the Ant Media Plugins repository.
Navigate to the HLSMerger folder.
Run the following Maven command to build the plugin:

```bash
mvn clean install -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dgpg.skip=true
```

The `HLSMerger.jar` file will be created in the `target` folder.

## Installing the Plugin
Copy the `HLSMerger.jar` file to the `/usr/local/antmedia/plugins` directory.
Restart the Ant Media Server service:

```bash
sudo service antmedia restart
```
